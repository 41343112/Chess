## Architecture

### Class Structure

**ChessPiece** (Abstract Base Class)
- Base class for all chess pieces
- Defines common properties: type, color, position, movement status
- Pure virtual method `isValidMove()` for piece-specific move validation

**Piece Subclasses**
- `Pawn` - Forward movement, diagonal capture, en passant, promotion
- `Rook` - Horizontal and vertical movement
- `Knight` - L-shaped movement
- `Bishop` - Diagonal movement
- `Queen` - Combined rook and bishop movement
- `King` - One square in any direction, castling

**ChessBoard**
- Manages 8x8 board state
- Handles move execution and validation
- Tracks game state (turn, check, checkmate, stalemate)
- Maintains move history
- Implements special move logic (castling, en passant)

**myChess (Main Window)**
- Qt-based GUI
- ChessSquare buttons for board interaction
- Game controls (New Game, Undo)
- Status and turn displays

**ChessSquare**
- Custom QPushButton for each board square
- Visual states: normal, selected, highlighted
- Displays piece symbols

## Getting Started

### Quick Start Guide

**For experienced Qt developers:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/41343112/Chess.git
cd Chess
qmake Chess.pro
make
./Chess
```

**For beginners:** Follow the detailed instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Before building the chess game, you need to install the following:

#### 1. Qt Framework (Qt 5.12+ or Qt 6.x)

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
# For Qt 5
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qt5-default qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev-tools

# For Qt 6
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install qt@5
# or
brew install qt@6

# Add Qt to PATH (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile)
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@5/bin:$PATH"  # for Qt 5
# or
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/qt@6/bin:$PATH"  # for Qt 6
```

**Windows:**
1. Download Qt Online Installer from [qt.io/download](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer)
2. Run the installer and select:
   - Qt 5.15.x or Qt 6.x
   - MinGW compiler (or MSVC if you have Visual Studio)
   - Qt Creator IDE
3. Complete the installation

#### 2. C++ Compiler

**Linux:**
```bash
# GCC (usually pre-installed)
sudo apt-get install build-essential
g++ --version  # Verify installation
```

**macOS:**
```bash
# Xcode Command Line Tools
xcode-select --install
```

**Windows:**
- MinGW comes with Qt installer, or
- Install Visual Studio 2019/2022 with C++ workload

#### 3. Verify Installation

Check that Qt tools are available:
```bash
qmake --version
```

Expected output should show Qt version 5.x or 6.x.

### Building and Running

#### Method 1: Command Line (Quick Start)

**Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository**
```bash
# If using git
git clone https://github.com/41343112/Chess.git
cd Chess

# Or download and extract ZIP, then navigate to the directory
```

**Step 2: Build the Project**
```bash
# Generate Makefile
qmake Chess.pro

# Compile the project
make

# On Windows with MinGW, use:
# mingw32-make
```

**Step 3: Run the Application**
```bash
# Linux/macOS
./Chess

# Windows
Chess.exe
# or double-click Chess.exe in the build directory
```

#### Method 2: Qt Creator (Recommended for Beginners)

**Step 1: Open the Project**
1. Launch Qt Creator
2. Click "File" → "Open File or Project"
3. Navigate to the Chess directory
4. Select `Chess.pro` and click "Open"

**Step 2: Configure Project**
1. Qt Creator will show "Configure Project" screen
2. Select a Qt kit (e.g., "Desktop Qt 5.15.2 MinGW 64-bit")
3. Click "Configure Project"

**Step 3: Build and Run**
1. Click the green "Run" button (▶) in the bottom-left corner, or
2. Press `Ctrl+R` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+R` (macOS)
3. The chess game window will appear

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: "qmake: command not found"**
- Solution: Ensure Qt bin directory is in your PATH
- Linux/macOS: Add Qt path to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
- Windows: Add Qt bin directory to System Environment Variables

**Issue: "Project ERROR: Unknown module(s) in QT: widgets"**
- Solution: Install Qt widgets module:
  ```bash
  # Linux
  sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev
  ```

**Issue: Build fails with C++17 errors**
- Solution: Ensure your compiler supports C++17
- Update GCC to version 7+ or use Clang 5+

**Issue: Application doesn't start on Windows**
- Solution: Copy Qt DLLs to the executable directory:
  ```bash
  # Navigate to Qt bin directory and copy required DLLs
  # For MinGW Qt 5.15:
  Qt5Core.dll, Qt5Gui.dll, Qt5Widgets.dll
  # Plus platform plugin: platforms/qwindows.dll
  ```
  Or run from Qt Creator which handles this automatically.

**Issue: Black screen or UI issues**
- Solution: Update graphics drivers
- Try running with software rendering: `export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen`

### What You'll See

Once the application is running, you'll see:

**Game Board:**
- 8×8 chessboard with alternating light (cream #F0D9B5) and dark (brown #B58863) squares
- Unicode chess pieces: ♔ ♕ ♖ ♗ ♘ ♙ (white) and ♚ ♛ ♜ ♝ ♞ ♟ (black)
- Clean, professional appearance similar to Chess.com

**Interactive Elements:**
- Click any piece to select it (highlighted in gold)
- Valid moves are highlighted in light green
- Turn indicator shows "Turn: White" or "Turn: Black"
- Status bar displays game state (check, checkmate, stalemate)
- "New Game" button to restart
- "Undo" button (placeholder for future functionality)

**Example Game State:**
```
Initial position with standard chess setup:
Rank 8: ♜ ♞ ♝ ♛ ♚ ♝ ♞ ♜
Rank 7: ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟ ♟
Rank 6-3: Empty squares
Rank 2: ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙ ♙
Rank 1: ♖ ♘ ♗ ♕ ♔ ♗ ♘ ♖
```

## How to Play

1. **Starting a Game**
   - White moves first
   - Click on a piece to select it
   - Valid moves will be highlighted in green
   - Click on a highlighted square to move

2. **Making Moves**
   - Only pieces of the current player can be selected
   - Moves must follow chess rules
   - The game prevents illegal moves that would put your king in check

3. **Special Moves**
   - **Castling**: Click on your king, then click two squares toward the rook
   - **En Passant**: Available when opponent's pawn moves two squares forward
   - **Pawn Promotion**: Pawns automatically promote to Queens upon reaching the opposite end

4. **Winning**
   - Checkmate: Opponent's king is in check with no legal moves
   - Stalemate: Current player has no legal moves but is not in check (Draw)

5. **Game Controls**
   - **New Game**: Start a fresh game
   - **Undo**: (Note: Feature placeholder in current version)

## Game Status Messages

- "Game in progress" - Normal play
- "White is in check!" / "Black is in check!" - King under attack
- "White wins by checkmate!" / "Black wins by checkmate!" - Game over
- "Stalemate - Draw!" - Game ends in a draw

## Technical Implementation Details

### Move Validation
- Two-stage validation:
  1. Piece-specific rules (each piece class)
  2. Board-level checks (wouldn't put king in check)

### Check Detection
- Scans all opponent pieces to see if they can attack the king
- Prevents moves that would leave own king in check

### Checkmate Detection
- King is in check
- No legal moves available to escape check

### Stalemate Detection
- King is not in check
- No legal moves available

## Future Enhancements

Possible additions for future versions:
- Full undo/redo functionality
- Move history display with algebraic notation
- Timer/clock for timed games
- Save/load game state
- Piece promotion choice dialog (currently auto-promotes to Queen)
- Opening book and game analysis
- Online multiplayer
- AI opponent
