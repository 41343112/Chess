  IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE: Language Switcher for Start Dialog
================================================================================

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  開始介面能根據選擇的語言轉換語言

   selected language)

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
  Added a dynamic language selector to the StartDialog that allows users to
  switch between English and Chinese instantly without requiring an
  application restart.

  TECHNICAL DETAILS
================================================================================

Architecture:
  - Uses QTranslator for runtime translation management
  - QComboBox for language selection
  - QSettings for preference storage
  - Qt translation system (tr()) for all text

Implementation Pattern:
  1. User selects language from dropdown
  2. onLanguageChanged() slot triggered
  3. Language saved to QSettings
  4. applyLanguage() loads appropriate translator
  5. updateTexts() refreshes all UI elements

Translation Files:
  - Source: chess_zh_CN.ts (XML format)
  - Compiled: chess_zh_CN.qm (binary)
  - Embedded in: resources.qrc
  - Path: :/translations/chess_zh_CN.qm

Settings Storage:
  - Organization: "ChessGame"
  - Application: "Settings"
  - Key: "language"
  - Values: "en" (English), "zh" (Chinese)
  - Default: "en"

================================================================================
  TESTING
================================================================================

Build Status:
  ✓ Compiles successfully with Qt 6.4.2
  ✓ No new warnings or errors
  ✓ All existing warnings preserved (unrelated to changes)

Automated Tests:
  ✓ Default language setting validated
  ✓ English setting save/load verified
  ✓ Chinese setting save/load verified
  ✓ Translation file existence confirmed

Code Quality:
  ✓ Follows Qt best practices
  ✓ Consistent with existing code style
  ✓ Proper memory management
  ✓ Clean separation of concerns
  ✓ No memory leaks

Integration:
  ✓ Works with existing translation system
  ✓ Compatible with Settings dialog language option
  ✓ No impact on other components
  ✓ Backward compatible
